# Minesweeper-Game
Project Overview: This project is an implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. The game features both Beginner and Expert levels with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to interact with the game using mouse clicks. The game logic handles the distribution of mines, grid management, and win/lose conditions. Players can also flag mines and reveal tiles.
Levels:
Beginner Level: A 9x9 grid with randomly scattered mines.
Expert Level: A 16x16 grid with more complex mine distribution.
